## Hi!
My name is Diego Akira Garc√≠a Rojas (Ak13a). I'm a Computer Science student and Cybersecurity enthusiast located in Peru. One of my main hobbies is writing and playing CTFs, so I decided to create this website to write about any topic I find interesting and also post my CTF writeups. I also have an interest on developing software, so you can check out my portfolio to see what I've cooked/I'm cooking!

### Interests and skills
- Python scripting and developing
- CTF challenges, particularly Web Exploitation and Cryptography
